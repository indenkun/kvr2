Description: Provides functions to calculate nine types of coefficients of determination (R-squared) based on the classification by Kvalseth (1985) DOI:10.1080/00031305.1985.10479448. 
    This package is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how R-squared values can fluctuate depending on the choice of formula, particularly in power regression models or linear models without an intercept. 
    By providing a comprehensive list of definitions, it helps users understand the mathematical sensitivity of goodness-of-fit indices.
