Description: The determination coefficient for linear or power regression models 
   is based on the determination coefficients according to Kvalseth's nine 
  classifications (eight classifications of existing methods and one proposed method).
  Kvalseth's classification is based on Tarald O. Kvålseth (1985) Cautionary Note 
  about R 2 , The American Statistician, 39:4, 279-285, DOI: 10.1080/00031305.1985.10479448.
  This package is not intended for detailed verification of the coefficient of determination.
  It is an educational package designed to confirm that the coefficient of determination 
  may differ depending on the specific definition formula used, as classified by Kvalseth (1985).
