#' Calculate the adjusted determination coefficient
#' @description
#' Calculate the adjusted coefficient of determination by entering the regression model and coefficient of determination.
#' See details.
#' @inheritParams r2
#' @param r2 A numeric. Coefficient of determination.
#' @details
#' The adjustment factor \eqn{a} is calculated using the following formula.
#' \deqn{a = (n - 1) / (n - k - 1)}
#' \eqn{n} is the sample size, and \eqn{k} is the number of parameters in the regression model.
#'
#' \eqn{R^2_a} (\eqn{R^2 adjusted}) is calculated using the following formula.
#' \deqn{R^2_a = 1 - a (1 - R^2)}
#'
#' This function performs freedom-of-degrees adjustment for all coefficients based on the above formula. However, Kvalseth (1985) recommends applying freedom-of-degrees adjustment only to \eqn{R^2_1} and \eqn{R^2_9}, based on the principle of consistency in coefficients.
#' Furthermore, there is no basis for applying the same type of adjustment to \eqn{R^2_6} (the square of the correlation coefficient) or to \eqn{R^2_7} and \eqn{R^2_8}, which depend on specific model forms.
